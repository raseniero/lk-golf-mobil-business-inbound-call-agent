This is a high-priority POC task that serves as the foundation for the MVP implementation.
# Details:
This task establishes the fundamental infrastructure needed for the POC and subsequent MVP development. Focus on creating a solid foundation that can be easily extended as the project grows.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup, directory structure, and environment variable configuration. Review database schema designs. Ensure all setup components are properly configured and ready for POC development.
