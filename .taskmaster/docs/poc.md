# **POC for the Mobile Golf Club Repair Voice AI Agent**

## **Overview**

Using the existing code base, I want to build a proof-of-concept by hardcoding the data into the agent.py. I would like to hardcode the schedule/location as a table in the prompt file under ./prompts folder. I will hard code also the type of services offered for that day and time. As well as mock the taking of appointment into Calendly.
